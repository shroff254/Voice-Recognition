#### A Novel Windowing Technique for Efficient Computation of MFCC for Speaker Recognition
#### 10.1109/LSP.2012.2235067
##### Abstract:
> In this letter, we propose a novel family of windowing technique to compute mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) for automatic speaker recognition from speech. The proposed method is based on fundamental property of discrete time Fourier transform (DTFT) related to differentiation in frequency domain. Classical windowing scheme such as Hamming window is modified to obtain derivatives of discrete time Fourier transform coefficients. It is mathematically shown that this technique takes into account slope of power spectrum and phase information. Speaker recognition systems based on our proposed family of window functions are shown to attain substantial and consistent performance improvement over baseline single tapered Hamming window as well as recently proposed multitaper windowing technique.

#### Comparative study regarding characteristic features of the human voice
#### 10.1109/ECAI.2015.7301206
##### Abstract:
> Each human voice has its own characteristic features. The features that describe the human voice can be: the pitch, the energy of the signal, the mean value, the median value, the MFCC coefficients, and others. Some of the natural questions that come to mind are: which are the features that best characterize the human voice? What is the minimum number of features that can completely characterize the human voice? In order to answer these questions a database of human voices is used, along with different feature extraction algorithms. Just extracting the features is not enough. Some classification algorithms need to be compared in order to find the best one for the data that is available.

The features that describe the human voice can be: the pitch, the energy of the signal, the mean value, the median value, the MFCC coefficients, and others. Some of the natural questions that come to mind are: which are the features that best characterize the human voice? What is the minimum number of features that can completely characterize the human voice? In order to answer these questions a database of human voices is used, along with different feature extraction algorithms. Just extracting the features is not enough. Classification algorithms will be tried and used for classification of distinct speakers.
